This is an extension to the Codeigniter core output class.

It allows you to do time-intensive processing after output has been sent to a client browser. 
I use it for image processing, thumbnail generation, CDN uploads and RSS feed analysis.

In PHP this is usually accomplished with output buffering (or through inconvenient exec() calls to other scripts), 
but Codeigniter's output class has its own output buffering which will interfere with what you're doing.

requirements:
Codeigniter 2+
PHP 5.3.0

installation:
Copy MY_output.php to your application/core folder.
If you are using a custom subclass prefix (defined in application/config/config.php), rename the file and class name with your prefix.

usage:
Write a closure (a.k.a. anonymous function) that includes your post-processing code. (see http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php if you're new to closures)
Optionally make an array that includes any variables your enclosure might need. This can include Codeigniter via the get_instance() function.
Register your code with the output class via:
     $this->output->do_closure_after_output($closure, $parameters);

You can register as many closures as you like.


This is my first pieces of published code. If you find it useful, or have suggestions, I would love to hear from you.
